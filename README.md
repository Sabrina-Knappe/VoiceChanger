# VoiceChanger
A voice changer software prototype for avatar therapy, my code submission for my COMP400 Undergraduate Project at McGill.

voicemod.mlapp is the application itself which can be run if you have matlab installed on your computer. The other files are programs which analyze, transform, and synthesize audio files (wav format) and helper files for the transformations.
